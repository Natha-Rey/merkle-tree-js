This repository was created for the CSBC2000 class with the purpose to demonstrate how a Merkle tree is created.

## What is a Merkle Tree?

Named after Ralph Merkle, a Merkle tree is a data structure used to encode data efficiently and securely by repeatedly applying a hashing function. A Merkle tree consists of leaves, branches, and a root. The leaves are the hashes on the bottom row, the branches are the hashes in the center, and the root is the final top hash.
